forward traffic from router to computer, 
open wrt router,
look at the traffic from router,
turn on everything to look through the traffic


Plans for the week:
    1) Use wireshark from another device to find out wheather wemo is using UPnP protocol or TCP or both
    2) Trying to decode the TCP data send by wemo app
    3) Try to customize the router firmware to redirect traffic that is send by Wemo switch to a local PC
    4) Use other tool like Burp? to see the traffic send by wemo app or wemo switch
